# daCHOPWash
Logistics management application for Da CHOP Wash Car Wash system

Developers: Eric Helferty, Daniel Lalonde, Graham Corcoran, Lucius Bossio

This application was a collaborative Java Spring Boot webservice using an H2 database connection composed of dummy data. 
It demonstrates the use of Controllers, Services, Repositories, Entities, Autowiring, Get and Postmapping, 
the use of CrudRepository as well as several other annotations to implement backend-frontend communication.

The UI was developed using HTML and Materialize.css styling. Thymeleaf was used to handle data dealt with on the webpages.
